Synopsis:    Simple sequence (iterator) datatype and combinators
Description: 
    Simple sequence datatype, intended to transfer a finite number of
    elements from one data structure to another. Some transformations on sequences,
    like `filter`, `map`, `take`, `drop` and `append` can be performed before the
    sequence is iterated/folded on.
